Project Title : "Node.js & Git Setup - Tasks"

My name = Asad Nouman 

summary :

First I set up a git repository with a proper .gitignore and README, then initialized npm and created a hello.js script that prints a message, date, and Node.js version.
Next, I built a file-manager.js to create, read, append, list, and delete files using the fs module with error handling.
After that, I updated file-manager.js to work with command line arguments, added usage instructions, and used chalk for colored output.
Then, I created a basic HTTP server in server.js with routes for welcome, time, files, health, and proper 404 handling, also logging each request.
Finally, I pushed the project to a private GitHub repo, added collaborators, wrote a proper README.
